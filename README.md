## Backgroun and Motivation

This project comes from the research of Steven Kauwe who does materials informatics research as a Ph.D student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The current state of research in that area has focused on showing proof of concept machine learning using various data types. Because materials science is inherently chemistry based, researchers have found it is  useful to represent chemical systems based on their contituent elements. This is the foundation for what we will refer to as the composition-based feature vector (CBFV), which is a common method of vectorizing chemistry space in order to make it accessible to machine learning.
